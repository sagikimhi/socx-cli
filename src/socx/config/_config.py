    """Get a list of local settings file paths found in parent folders.

    Description
    -----------
    After initialization, `socx` searches parent directories for any file
    named '.socx.<ext>' where <ext> is any file extension supported by the
    `socx` configuration system.



    Local configuration overrides are any files named '.socx.yaml' which
    found in any of the parent directories of the current working directory.

    For reference, it works similar to git:

    1.  first, default app configurations are loaded to initialize to app's
        core functionality.

    2.  second, global user configurations are loaded from the user's
        config directory, determined according to the 'XDG Base Directory
        Specification' (https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec).

    3.  last, a search for local configuration files is done, matching (and
        loading) any configuration files named '.socx.yaml' found in any of the
        parent directories starting the search at the current working
        directory.

    Returns
    -------
    An ordered list of `Path` objects pointing at configuration files to be
    loaded in that exact order to preserve the described overrides order.
