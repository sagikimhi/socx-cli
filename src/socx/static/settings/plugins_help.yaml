      ## About

      Run `git` commands in parallel on multiple repositories!

      ANY `git` command will work!

      When invoked, `socx git` runs a flat search in the current *root* for
      nested repositories on startup.

      The invoked `git` command will then be ran on every repository found
      (unless excluded via -e/--exclude flag or app configuration) along with
      any flags and arguments that were passed with the command.

      Outputs from each repository will then be displayed in a pretty formatted
      graph tree.

      > ***TIP***
      >
      > * The `-p` or `--pager` flag may be passed to display the outputs in
      >   a pager.
      >
      > * The `-r` or `--root` path can be used to change the root path from
      >   which git repositories will be searched to invoke the command.
      >
      > * The `-e` or `--exclude` flag can be passed one or more times along with
      >   a glob/relative/absolute path to exclude repositories from the run.

      ## Examples

      - ***run `git status` of multiple repositories***:

          ```py
          socx git status
          ```

      - ***will show status of all repos under current directory***:

          ```py
          socx git status --root . # same as above, this is the default value of root
          ```

      - ***same as above but without repos 'foo' and 'bar'***:

          ```py
          socx git status -e foo -e bar
          ```

      - ***run `git fetch` on multiple repositories***:

          ```py
          socx git fetch # fetch all under current directory
          ```

      - ***same but exclude current directory and any repo who's name contains 'baz'***:

          ```py
          socx git fetch --exclude *baz* --exclude .
          ```

      - ***show a normal git diff of all repos in a pager***:

          ```py
          socx git diff --pager
          ```

      - ***same but this time only show the stat and ignore whitespaces***:

          ```py
          socx git diff --pager --stat --color-moved-ws=allow-indentation-change
          ```
