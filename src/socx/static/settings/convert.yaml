convert:
  lst:
    # Field: type
    #
    # Typename of the converter class for performing the conversion.
    #
    cls: >-
      @symbol
      socx_plugins.convert.converter:LstConverter

    # Field: source
    #
    # source directory from which names and patterns defined in include will
    # be searched.
    #
    source: >-
      @path @jinja
      {{ this.paths.APP_ROOT_DIR / '../Pixie_ROM_FW/PixieROMApp/TapeOutRelease/PIXIE_E4/PixieParserOut/outputs' |abspath }}

    # Field: target
    #
    # target directory to which generated outputs will be written.
    #
    target: >-
      @path @jinja
      {{ this.paths.APP_ROOT_DIR / '/assets/lst/outputs' |abspath }}

    # Field: base_addr_map
    #
    # Name of the json adress map file of ROM base addresses.
    #
    base_addr_map: "memLd.json"

    # Field: base_addr_base
    #
    # The address value's numeric base (hex/octal/decimal/etc.)
    #
    base_addr_base: 16

    # Field: include
    #
    # Specifies file names to include in the convert's list of sources to
    # convert.
    #
    # Values can either be an exact filename, a glob pattern, or a
    # combination of both.
    #
    includes:
      - "*.lst"
      - SPUList.list

    # Field: exclude
    #
    # Same as include, but excludes files from the list of sources.
    #
    excludes: []

    # Field: mappings
    #
    # Mappings between source file names to target file names.
    #
    # Both source and target can either be an exact file name or a
    # 'match' pattern specified by the character %.
    #
    # A match pattern will simply match the missing part of the target's name with
    # the matching missing part in the source name.
    #
    mappings:
      - input: "%.lst"
        output: "%.svh"
      - input: "%.list"
        output: "%.sv"
      - input: hwsList.lst
        output: pixie_hws_cgs.svh

    # Option: collision
    #
    # How name collisions should be handled. In other words, what should the
    # convert do when an older version of the output file already exists
    # in the target directory.
    #
    # Options
    # -------
    # skip:
    #     filename collisions will be skipped, and the original file is
    #     kept.
    #
    # backup:
    #     same as overwrite, but creates a copy of the original file with
    #     with a '.backup.<timestamp>' file where <timestamp> is replaced
    #     with the date and time of when the back up was created.
    #
    # overwrite:
    #     filename collisions are handled by overwriting any existing file
    #     with the new one upon name collision.
    #
    options:
      collision: "overwrite"
